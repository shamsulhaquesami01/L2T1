The proof is by inducation on the number of iterations of the Ford-Fulkerson
method.
Basis: The initial flow f equals 0 in all edges, so that |f|=0.
Inductive step: By the inductive hypothesis, at the start of each iteration, f(u,v)
is an integer for all u, v belongs to V , so that |f|= for all v, f(s,v) - f(v,s)is also an
integer. Moreover, all residual capacities are integer as well, since they are either
f (u,v) for some u, v belongs to V or c(u,v) f(u,v) for some u, v belongs to V and c(u,v) is an
integer. Each iteration of the Ford-Fulkerson method updates the flow on each edge
by cf(p), where p is the augmenting path found. Since cf(p) equals the residual
capacity of some edge in p, it is an integer. Therefore, the change in f(u,v) for
each u, v belongs to V is plus or minus an integer value, so that it remains an integer value
